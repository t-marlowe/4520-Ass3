          <h4>Intent:</h4>
          <p>Welcome to McDavid's journey for 50 Goals, a website dedicated to tracking the progress of Connor McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers superstar and the best player in the NHL, as he tries to reach the elusive milestone of scoring 50 goals in a single season.

Join us as we follow McDavid's journey to 50 goals!</p>
          <h4>Process:</h4>
          <p>My passion for hockey and admiration for Connor McDavid inspired the process for creating this website. I wanted the users to experience McDavid's journey from his upbringing right up to getting his 50th goal. To do this, I did extensive research on McDavid's life story, his career milestones, his achievements and his challenges. I used Figma for designing the website and some of the custom made SVGs that illustrate McDavid's progress and statistics. I also used Font Awesome for the icons that add some flair and functionality to the website. Additionally, I used JavaScript for the modal component that displays more details about this website. My goal was to create a visually appealing and informative website that showcases McDavid's quest for 50 goals in an engaging way.</p>

            <p>Scoring 50 goals in the NHL is so significant because it is one of the most celebrated individual achievements in the league.</p>
            <p>It is a rare feat that only 91 players have accomplished since the NHL began play in 1917, and fewer than half of those have done it more than once.</p>
            <p>It is a mark of excellence, consistency, and skill that showcases a player's offensive prowess and dominance. </p>

            <p>McDavid has averaged 0.79 goals per game this season. That's an impressive rate that puts him on pace to score more than 60 goals in a full 82-game season. He has scored 55 goals in 67 games so far and is projected to have 66 goals by the end of the season.</p>
